# EDRPG Battlemaps
This is currently a work in progress. The maps have been added, and many of the ships have been added as well.

## Usage
- Change the map type using the map dropdown
- Add a spaceship by using the spaceship dropdown
  - Spaceships spawn in with their own names, but it can be edited to match a player/enemy name
- Spaceship status can be switched from "friendly" to "enemy" (this changes the underline color) and removed from the field
- Spaceships can be dragged around and placed into the "up close" or "at a distance" zones

## Goals
- Add all remaining ships
- Resize Mixed Combat Map to better fit screen
- Deploy demo
- Add vehicles
